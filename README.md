# BarKeep
A Simple bar management system


BarKeep is a very simple application to keep track of useful information for bar managers. Users can create new items to stock in their
inventory(represented by the bottle class). They are also able to select a category for the item, as well as it's volume, wholesale cost,
retail price, par level, and the actual number on hand. There is also a field for notes which shows up in the detail view. This is the 
bare bones skeleton for a larger project that will add more features. The project can be run by downloading the repo and opening the
BarKeep.sln file.
